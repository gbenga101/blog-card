## My process
I'm through with this project

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I basically used css flexbox for everything, it makes my work easier and responsive. I also love the fact that without using javaScript I can still create small animations on css makes it fun. Below are examples


```html
<div class="attribution">
    Challenge by <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io?ref=challenge" target="_blank">Frontend Mentor</a>. 
    Coded by <a href="https://twitter.com/FagbenroGbengaH">Gbenga Hassan Fagbenro</a>.
  </div>
```
```css
.botton:hover{
    transform: rotate(5deg);
  }
```
```css
.container{
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    border-radius: 20px;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    border-top: 1px solid;
    border-right: 6px solid;
    border-bottom: 6px solid;
}
```

### Continued development

First of all, I need to dedicate time (daily) to keep practicing and working on HTML and CSS projects. After mastering css flexbox and Grid by building enough project with them, I'll be adding javaScript to make my project looks lively
